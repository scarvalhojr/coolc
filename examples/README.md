The examples directory contains a few small and not so small
example programs which illustrate various aspects of the Cool
programming language. They were copied from the material
distributed with the Stanford Online Compilers course.

- arith.cool - Tests various aspects of arithmetic in Cool.

- atoi.cool - An implementation of the C function by the same name. It converts
   a String into an Int.

- atoi_test.cool - An example program using atoi.cool. Since you will most
  likely use atoi.cool in the first assignment, you should study this example.

- list.cool - A very simple program showing how to create a list data type for
  integers. It illustrates inheritance and dynamic dispatch.

- book_list.cool - Illustrates inheritance and in particular the mechanism of
   STATIC DISPATCH and the CASE statement.

- cells.cool - Models a one-dimensional cellular automaton.

- cool.cool - An short and obscure program.

- io.cool - Shows how to use the IO class (input/output).

- hairyscary.cool - Exercises many of the obscure features of the language in
  obscure ways.

- hello_world.cool - The classic first program.

- primes.cool - An unusual prime number generator.

- graph.cool - A program reading descriptions of weighted-directed graphs from
  stdin in text format.

- g1.graph - A sample input to graph.cool.

- palindrome.cool - Recognizes palindromes.

- complex.cool - Checks the = operator and cummulative effects of method calls
  via a complex number object.

- life.cool - The classic Game of Life.

- sort_list.cool - A more complex example sorting lists of integers.
